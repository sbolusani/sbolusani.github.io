      <p>I work on <strong>integer optimization</strong>, primarily
      <strong>mixed-integer linear optimization</strong> and its extensions to
      <strong>bilevel, multilevel, and multistage settings</strong>. I am
      interested in <strong>developing theory and algorithms</strong> for these
      problem classes, and understanding the algorithmic behavior upon
      <strong>implementation in actual solvers</strong>, with a focus on which
      theoretically sound ideas translate well into practice and why. A central
      theme of my work is trying to narrow the gap between optimization theory
      and practice.</p>

      <p>From 2021 to 2025, I worked as a researcher at <a href="https://zib.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zuse Institute
      Berlin</a> in the Mathematical Optimization Methods group, where I focused
      on mixed-integer linear optimization, both solving them from scratch and
      warm-starting them by transferring information from previous solves of
      similar problems. During this period, I contributed algorithmic components
      and computational tools to open-source solvers, most notably <a href="https://www.scipopt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCIP</a>.</p>

      <p>My Ph.D. work at <a href="https://www2.lehigh.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lehigh University</a> focuses on <strong>parametric valid
      inequalities</strong> and decomposition methods for multilevel and
      multistage mixed-integer linear optimization problems, with an emphasis on
      two levels and two stages. This work includes the development of
      <strong>generalized Benders' decomposition framework</strong> and
      algorithms for these problem classes, <strong>warm starting</strong> of
      mixed-integer linear optimization problems, and corresponding solver
      implementations intended to support further research.</p>

      <p>Across my academic and professional work, I have contributed to
      multiple open-source solvers such as SCIP, <a href="https://github.com/coin-or/SYMPHONY" target="_blank" rel="noopener
      ">SYMPHONY</a>, <a href="https://github.com/coin-or/mibs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MibS</a>, and <a href="https://minotaur-solver.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">MINOTAUR</a>, primarily in C and C++, with
      supporting tools and interfaces in Python, such as <a href="https://github.com/scipopt/PySoPlex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener
      ">PySoPlex</a>. I also have experience with commercial solvers and
      modeling languages, including CPLEX, Gurobi, and AMPL. These experiences
      cover algorithmic components, solver integration, and computational
      benchmarking.</p>
