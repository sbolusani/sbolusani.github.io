      <main>
         <p>My teaching experience stems from roles I held during my Ph.D. studies at Lehigh
University and my Master’s studies at IIT Bombay. These roles included serving as a
primary instructor, teaching assistant, and guest lecturer for courses in
optimization, data analysis, and computational methods.</p>

<p><em>Adjunct Lecturer</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ISE 426 – Optimization Models and Applications</strong></p>

    <p>Primary instructor for an undergraduate course covering the basics of linear
vs nonlinear optimization, continuous vs (mixed-)integer optimization, and
deterministic vs stochastic optimization; their modeling techniques and
solution algorithms; and their practical applications.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Teaching Assistant</em></p>

<p>As a teaching assistant, my responsibilities included leading tutorial and lab
sessions, assisting with assignments and projects, grading, and supporting
students with modeling, algorithmic concepts, and

  <li><strong>ISE 224 – Information Systems Analysis and Design</strong></li>
  <li><strong>ISE 172 – Algorithms in Systems Engineering</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Guest Lectures</em></p>

<p>I delivered guest lectures on selected technical topics, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Generalized Benders’ decomposition framework</li>
  <li>The Hungarian method for assignment problems</li>
  <li>Use of AMPL with commercial and open-source optimization solvers</li>
  <li>Installation and batch experimentation with the SYMPHONY solver</li>
  <li>Apache Spark SQL and DataFrames</li>
  <li>Pygame for computational experiments</li>
  <li>Introduction to the COR@L Lab</li>
</ul>
